🧠 Backend & Data Storage in an AI Agent (Vector-based Search)
To enable an AI agent to remember and retrieve information, a specialized backend setup is used that involves:

🔄 1. Data Ingestion & Embedding
The raw text or data we provide (e.g., a document, user query, or webpage) is first converted into numerical form called embeddings.

These embeddings are vectors—high-dimensional representations of the meaning of text.

This transformation is done using models like OpenAI’s embeddings, Sentence Transformers, or BERT.

🧠 2. Vector Database
These embeddings are stored in a vector database such as Pinecone, FAISS, Chroma, or Weaviate.

Unlike regular databases, vector databases allow similarity-based searches using vector math instead of exact keyword matches.

Each stored vector is usually linked to metadata (e.g., the original text, tags, timestamps).

🔍 3. Semantic Search using KNN (k-Nearest Neighbors)
When a user asks a question, that query is also converted into an embedding.

The system uses KNN search to find vectors in the database that are closest to the query vector (based on cosine similarity or Euclidean distance).

This means it can understand context and meaning, not just keywords.

For example, if you ask “What is a capital of France?”, it will retrieve entries similar to “Paris is the capital of France.”

⚙️ 4. Application Logic (Backend)
Typically built with frameworks like FastAPI, Flask, or Django.

It handles:

Uploading data

Generating embeddings

Interacting with the vector database

Serving search results to the frontend
